Entry description: The picture was taken in July 2014. It describes a typical day of a rice planting day in hilly area of Nepal. Every member of the house hold participates and goes in the field to plant the rice. Nepal has a sustainable agriculture farming system. Every household is a farmer and has a small piece of land and few domestic animals. They live from the food they produce in field and from animals they raise. Rice is a staple food in Nepal and this picture shows a typical rice cultivation day in the hills. The field shown here is almost ready to plant the rice saplings. Farmers use ox and human power (spades) to plough the field and make it ready for planting. Usually male members plough the field and female members plant the rice. Female members of the house in the far of the picture are planting the rice. Starting from a kid you are taught about farming system. They get involved in every little way they can in the agriculture system. It is in fact fun for children to play and at the same time learn about the agriculture system and hardship of life.","THUMBNAIL_FILE_NAME":"FarmingSystemthumb.jpg","WEB_VERSION_FILE_NAME":"FarmingSystemsmall.jpg","FULL_SIZE_FILE_NAME":"FarmingSystem.jpg","CREATOR_NAME":"Pratima Adhikari","DATE_CREATED":"2015-06-25T16:24:29.790"},{"ID":1947,"LABEL":"Cash Cows and Little Goat, Too","DESCRIPTION":"The first place winner of the 2015 Ag Abroad Photo Contest. Entry description: This photo of a Datoga woman was taken near Lake Eyasi in Tanzania, as she milked one of her family's cows and allowed a baby goat to nurse from the cow. The woman pictured is one of five sister wives who are the main caretakers of the family's large herd of cattle and goats. The women of the family will labor many hours a day to milk, feed and water the herd. The Datoga are a pastoralist tribe that place a high value on cattle for their livelihood and as a symbol of status. Every part of the cow is used, from the day-to-day milk for nutrients and dung for wall plaster, to the bones, hide and meat upon slaughter. Cattle are used as a currency for bride prices, and a large herd is seen as a status symbol in the community. Goats are also used as a currency, though are seen as much less valuable.","THUMBNAIL_FILE_NAME":"CashCowsandaLittleGoatToothumb.jpg","WEB_VERSION_FILE_NAME":"CashCowsandaLittleGoatToosmall.jpg","FULL_SIZE_FILE_NAME":"CashCowsandaLittleGoatToo.jpg","CREATOR_NAME":"Charlotte Goldman","DATE_CREATED":"2015-06-25T16:27:44.900"},{"ID":1948,"LABEL":"Free Range 2015","DESCRIPTION":"This small farm, in the suburbs of Beihing, China, is interesting.
