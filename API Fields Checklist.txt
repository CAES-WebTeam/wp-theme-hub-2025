IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
================================================================================

1. API Structure:
   - Initial call gets user basic info: /users?query=...
   - Related data requires relationships call: /users/[ID]/relationships
   - Use detail=full parameter for complete data
   - May need per-page parameter to handle large result sets

2. XML Parsing Notes:
   - API returns XML (not JSON, despite format=json parameter)
   - Use SimpleXML with namespace: http://www.symplectic.co.uk/publications/api
   - User basic data is in <api:object> attributes
   - Related data (publications, activities, etc.) will be in relationships response

3. Current Implementation Status:
   - Basic user API call is working
   - Returns user attributes from <api:object> element
   - Frontend tabs are in place for all data types
   - Need to implement relationships endpoint calls

4. Next Steps:
   - Examine full XML response for user endpoint to find bio, keywords, degrees
   - Implement relationships endpoint call
   - Parse publications, activities, and teaching-activities from relationships
   - Map XML structure to frontend display format

5. Questions for Sunshine:
   - Where is citation count data located in API response?
   - Confirm field names for bio/overview, keywords in user response
   - Verify structure for degrees and academic appointments

REFERENCE DOCUMENTS ATTACHED BY SUNSHINE:

- API Instructions (page 7 has example call)
- Schema documentation
- Postman Schema
- List of Elements field names

Next meeting: Schedule work session if needed to hash out details
